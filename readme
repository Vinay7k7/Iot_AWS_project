>> In this project i have made a python code that act as an iot devides that is capable of generating the data in an time duration and this simulator will connect
to the aws!!!


1)--> i will create a thing in the aws iot core and i would downlode the required certificate , private and public and CA1.pam files
      in order to register the iot device in my case for the simulator code in the place of actual iot device.
2)--> then i will create aws mqtt client to make pipeline of communaction with the code to the aws client endpoint after that i wil make a connection 
      with the aws client.
3)--> then based on the architecture (aws) we need to create a connection between the aws-iot to the lambda for the formating and for the performing
      threshold operations in our project and also we intended to use lambda in our project and in lambda we have written a pyhon script that will
      formate the incoming plain onld json formated data and converts that json into customized message and send it to the sns.
4)--> While we are creating the iot rule we need to specify the what data that we need to send the Lambda for that we are using the iot rule sql query
        in that wee will give 

                        { "SELECT *,timestamp() as ts FROM 'Safety_Monitoring/Topic01' 
                                                                     where water_pressure > 65 or fire > 335 or air_pressure > 800" }



      In this above you need to replace the iot topic u have created and your  thresholds âšŸ 


5)--> While i am creating the rule i need to mention the service that i need to connect in this case i am connecting the Lambda and from there on to the 
      SNS and in lambda we need to write the scrip that formates the data and can do somthing operational too.âš¡

6)--> In the destination we can place the sns that you have created and there on the user will get the notification ðŸ”” to the user
      and also in other hand we need to store the data (triggerd data) in to the DynamoDB.
7)--> In the third part in need to monamonitor nd visualize the every data appart from if it is triggered or not as it is a different part we need to 
      create a different iot_rule where the sql query should be



                  {" SELECT water_pressure,fire,air_pressure,room,floor FROM 'Safety_Monitoring/Topic01' "}



8)--> this rule creation we need to add the action as the timestream because it is live data storage service in aws and easy to use and easy to view the
      Data in that.
9)--> From there on we will create the AWS_grefana workspace and add the user in the workspace and don't forgot to make that user as the admin and also you
      need to add the respective polices for that user to access the grefana.
10)--> In the created grafana workspace we can ad the data service that we need to monitor in this case we are using the timestream so we will create
      and connect the timestream databasse and table we want to monitor in the grefana 
11)--> At last we need to run the simulator code then the generated json formated data would go the aws client (mqtt) from there it goes to the iot rules
      from there on it go's to the iot_rule_Of_Lambda where the data is filtered by the query and it sends the filtered the data to the lambda for the
      formating and to perform the conditions in the data
12)--> In other hand the json data from mqtt client to the timestream for the live storage and forther to stream in the grafana.
